# 🌍 airIQ – Intelligence Air Quality Dashboard

> 🚀 A complete environmental intelligence platform for real-time AQI monitoring, predictive simulation, and comparative analytics.

airIQ is a full-stack environmental intelligence platform engineered to monitor and predict the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using advanced ensemble machine learning. The system combines a responsive frontend, a Flask-based REST API, and a high-accuracy hybrid ML pipeline to deliver actionable environmental insights.
